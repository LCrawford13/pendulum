# Pendulum
This repository contains code allowing the simulation of a simple pendulum over one full period of motion. The data can then also be used to produce an animation of the simulation. The length, gravitational acceleration, initial angle, initial angular velocity and the position of the pivot can all be specified, all only on a 2D plane.
